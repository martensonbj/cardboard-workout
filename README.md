## [Demo](http://nfosterky.github.io/cardboard-workout/)

A Google Cardboard Virtual Reality Thigh Workout app.

To be used with iOS or Android mobile devices. The user squats to hit obstacles.

This was my first attempt at using a devices accelerometer to control a camera in a 3d environment. In this environment the camera has two positions, either up or down.

[visualize.html](http://nfosterky.github.io/cardboard-workout/visualize) was used to visualize normalized (between -1 and 1) acceleration data. red = x-axis, green = y-axis, blue = z-axis

recordData.html was used to record and label movement accelerations over a period of time.

sensorData.html was used to view raw accelerometer data.
